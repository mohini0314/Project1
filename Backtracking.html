<header><p>Backtraking</p></header>

<para1>
<p>Backtracking is a form of recursion. <br><br>

The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your <br>
choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is <br>
repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if <br>
you didn't, it isn't. <br><br>
   
Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that <br>
the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. t each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its <br>
children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf. <br><br>
    
Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, <br>
and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try <br>
another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found. <br><br>
    
This needs an example. <br>

<p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could <br>
make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we <br> 
have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)

<h2>The backtracking algorithm.<h2>

    <codetext><pre>
      boolean solve(Node n) { 
        if n is a leaf node { 
          if the leaf is a goal node, return true 
          else return false 
        } else { 
          for each child c of n { 
            if solve(c) succeeds, return true 
          } 
          return false

    <para1>
    <p>
    Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If <br>
    solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root <br>
    to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
    </p></para1></div>
    <br>

   <h2>How does this work?</h2>
   <para1>
   <ul>
   <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
   <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.  </li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any<br>
     child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>

     <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a <br>
      goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>

     <h2>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h2>
     <para1>
     <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact,<br>
      that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.</p>
      </para1>

    <div style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
    border-radius: 10px;
    opacity: 1;">
    <codetext><pre>
      boolean solve(Node n) { 
        put node n on the stack; 
        while the stack is not empty { 
          if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf { 
             if it is a goal node, return true 
             else pop it off the stack 
           } 
           else { 
            if the node at the top of the stack has untried children  
              push the next untried child onto the stack 
            else pop the node off the stack 
          } 
         return false 
        }  </pre>
    </codetext></div> 
    

     <br><br>
     <para1>
     
      Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the <br>
      stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the <br>
      tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,<br>
      if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the <br>
      problem. <br><br>
      When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal <br>
      node. <br><br>
      Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of <br>
      recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node <br>
      at the current level, or storing it in an array. <br><br>
      
      Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path: <br>

      <h2>Keeping backtracking simple</h2>
      <br>
      
    <para1>
      All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty <br>
      cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex: <br><br>
      
      for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate<br>
      solutions <br><br>
      
      To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test <br>
      whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b style="color:#424242">gameOver method</b> (or you could even call it <b style="color:#424242">isLeaf).</b> This method would encapsulate all the <br>
      ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain. <br><br>
      
      Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have <br>
      been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <b style="color:#424242">for each child<br>
      c of n.</b> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through<br>
      them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can <br>
      represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track<br>
      of which ones you've already examined? <br><br>
      
      The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the <br>
      node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When <br>
      the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require <br>
      quite a lot of additional work. <br><br>
      
      There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an <br>
      ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next. <br><br>
      
      For example, you might be able to number the <b style="color:#424242">children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried <br>
      <b style="color:#424242">child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b style="color:#424242">k-1,</b> and you have not yet tried children <b style="color:#424242">k+1</b> through <b style="color:#424242">n.</b> Or, if you <br>
      are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try <b style="color:#424242">red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b> If child yellow fails, <br>
      you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right <b style="color:#424242">(or perhaps <br>
      north, east, south, west).</b><br><br>
      
      It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <b style="color:#424242">In the chess game example,</b> you might number your <br>
      pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each piece may also have several <br>
      moves, and these must also be ordered. 
    </para1> 
    <br><br>

    <h2>Example: Tree Search</h2>
    <para1>
      For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the <br>
      simplest kind of tree, a binary tree. <br><br>
      
      A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point <br>
      to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. <br>
      All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not <br>
      part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The <br>
      first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree. <br><br>
      
      Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:<br>
    </para1><br>

    <div style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
    border-radius: 10px;
    opacity: 1;">
    <codetext><pre>
      public class BinaryTree { 
         BinaryTree leftChild = null; 
         BinaryTree rightChild = null;
         boolean isGoalNode = false;
         String name; 
         
         BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
          this.name = name; 
          leftChild = left; 
          rightChild = right; 
          this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode; 
        } 
      } </pre>
  </codetext></div> 
<br>
   <para1>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.</para1>
   <br><br>
   
   <div style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
    border-radius: 10px;
    opacity: 1;">
    <codetext><pre>
    static BinaryTree makeTree() { 
      BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f; 
      c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false); 
      d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false); 
      e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);
      f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false); 
      a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false); 
      b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false); 
      root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);
      return root; 
    } </pre>
</codetext></div> 
   <br>

   <para1>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</para1><br><br>
   
   <div style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
   border-radius: 10px;
   opacity: 1;">
   <codetext><pre>
    public static void main(String args[]) { 
      BinaryTree tree = makeTree(); 
      System.out.println(solvable(tree)); 
    } 
  </pre>
    </codetext></div> <br>

   <para1>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</para1><br><br>

   <div style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
    border-radius: 10px;
    opacity: 1;">
    <codetext><pre>
    static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) { 
    /* 1 */ if (node == null) return false; 
    /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true; 
    /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true; 
    /* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true; 
    /* 5 */ return false;
    } </pre>
    </codetext></div> <br>

<para1>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable.This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without<br>
first checking whether those children actually exist.</li><br>
<li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li><br>
<li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null<br> 
and is not a goal node, says to</li><br>
<li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li><br>
<li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li>
</ol>
</para1>

<br>
<para1>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.<br><br>
  Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An<br>
  alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version: 
</para1><br><br>
    
    <div style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;

      static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) { 
        if (node.isGoalNode) return true; 
        if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true; 
        if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true; 
        return false; 
      }
    </pre>
    </codetext></div> 
      <br>

     <para1>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</para1>

      <br>
      <h2>What are the children?</h2>
      <para1>
        One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous <br>
        choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the <br>
        right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without <br>
        recursion. <br><br>
        
        Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter <br>
        how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the <br>
        same color. <br><br>
        
        To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are <br>
        colored. <br><br>
        
        There are two ways to do this:<br>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li><br>
        <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of <br>
          countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
      </ol><br>
      Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a <br>
      checkerboard only needs two colors.</para1><br>
      
      <h2>boolean mapIsOK()</h2>
      <para1>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.</para1> <br>
      
      <h2>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</h2>
      <para1>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.</para1><br>
      
      <h2>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</h2>
      <para1>Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard). </para1><br>

      <para1>Here's the code for method 1:</para1><br><br>

      The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of <br>
      these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will <br>
      often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically <br>
      guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!

    <h2>Debugging techniques</h2>
    <para1>
      Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall <br>
      back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be <br>
      applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.<br>
    </para1>
    <br>
    <h2>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits. </h2>
      <para1>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably <br>
        want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long <br>
        list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</para1><br>
     
      <h2> Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</h2> 
       <para1>
       <p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself <br>
       contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with </p>
       
       <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs <br> 
        the proportions will be better.</p></para1><br>

      <h3>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h3>

        <para1><p>
        Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug <br>
        the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away? <br><br>
        
        Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to<br> 
        your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, <br>
        you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these <br>
        changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program. <br><br>
        
        The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,<br><br>

      <para1>
      <p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about <br>
        making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the <br>
        controlled code will be discarded.</p></para1>

              puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to <br>
              print out the bad news.<br><br>
              
              The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, <br>
              which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy. <br><br>
              
              Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board <br>
              position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. <br>
              Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves. <br><br>
              
              Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of <br>
              approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find <br>
              a different but equally valid approach. <br><br>
              
              First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, <br>
              it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and <br>
              check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require <br>
              having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the <br>
              board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive. <br><br>
              
              Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a <br>
              particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that <br>
              must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight <br>
              complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.<br><br>

              <b style="color:#424242">Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each<br> 
              space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int <br>
              position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</b></p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
              <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
              <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
            </ul>
        
        We write another method int[] <b style="color:#424242">makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board and a position, make a move from <br>
        that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, <br>
        rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" <br>
        rather than "mutative." <br><br>
        
        Along with <b style="color:#424242">canMove and makeMove,</b> we are using methods <b style="color:#424242">puzzleSolved and printBoard</b> with meanings that <br>
        should be obvious. With these methods, our central backtracking method can be written as follows:
